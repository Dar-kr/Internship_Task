ALGORITM DESRIPTION

PROBLEM
Shortest Path between given points over triangle surface.

SOLUTION
We take a plane that contains start and finish points, 
then look for a intersection of this plane and surface
and calculate the length of this intersection. 
Then we turn it on the small corner around the line through 
start and finish points, look for new intercection and 
compare with previos. So we found a shortest path of all. 

The program can be improved for higher precision. It's 
enought to repeat searching around the angle with smallest 
path from the previos step. 

Start point have to lie on the vertex of the surface. 
Finish point can lie anywere. 
If start point lies anywere, program would be more difficult, 
but it could be done, if necessary.

I used simple STL file that describes cube with additional 
triangles on facets for general testing and looking for
different point positions. 
I used sets of points and other objects for testing
separate functions.
